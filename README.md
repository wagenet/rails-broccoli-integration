Rails Broccoli Integration Example
===

This is another approach to integrating Rails and Broccoli.
In this one, the code is completely siloed and we have a proxy server to join the two together.

Consider this a spike. It may change drastically in the future.

See also [broccoli-rails](https://github.com/wagenet/broccoli-rails) for another approach.
